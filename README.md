#### Dependency installation

The key thing you will need before getting started is NodeJS itself. You can follow the steps below to set everything up (if you have done some of these already, skip to the next step where appropriate):

1. Download and install [NodeJS here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux, macOS etc).
2. Make sure you now have NodeJS and NPM install by running the following commands in your command-line application of choice to check their versions:

Node: `node -v`
NPM: `npm -v`

If you received a version number as a response to each of those commands then you have everything you need to get started.
